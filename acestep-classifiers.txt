Tags to not use so the fuckup list

Red Flag 🚩     Description
Adjective stacking     "neon skies, electric hearts, endless dreams"—filling a section with vague imagery
Rhyme chaos     Inconsistent rhyme patterns, or forced rhymes causing semantic breaks
Blurred section boundaries     Lyric content crosses structure tags, Verse content "flows" into Chorus
No breathing room     Each line too long, can't sing in one breath
Mixed metaphors     First verse uses water imagery, second suddenly becomes fire, third is flying—listeners can't anchor
